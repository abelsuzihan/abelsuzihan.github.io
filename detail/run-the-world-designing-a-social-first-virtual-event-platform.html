    <h2>Design Approach</h2>
      <p>We adopted a Use Case - Goal - Solution - Feedback methodology to ensure our designs met user needs effectively. This approach facilitated rapid iteration and refinement, especially crucial in a remote work environment.</p>
      <p>In addition to UX design, I was responsible for defining RTW's brand identity and visual guidelines. Emphasizing a social-first approach, we ensured consistency across desktop and mobile platforms, providing users with a seamless experience regardless of device.</p>
